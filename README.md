📊 E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

This is my first Data Analytics project using SQL + Python.
The goal of this project is to analyze e-commerce sales data and understand:

Which products and categories sell the most 📦

Which cities/customers contribute high revenue 🏙️

How payment methods are used by customers 💳

Trends and patterns in orders and profits 📈

🛠 Tools & Technologies

MySQL – Data cleaning + business queries

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – Data analysis + Visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Code + results
